# Woden

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

To run the tests, run:

```
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yaml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```

To run the debug mode, run:

```
1) sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-debug.yml up
2) npm i
3) npm run debug
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
